# Temasek-Polytechnic-Major-Project-AY-2020-2021
The objective of this project is to create a playground whereby we can exhibit and demonstrate cybersecurity skills used in the real world, using a simulated sandbox 
corporate environment via VirtualBox. This will allow others to know how easy or challenging it is to penetrate a low-level employee into a C-level executive to obtain 
confidential material if the penetration is applied to a legitimate organization.   As an attacker, I would stealthily penetrate the company's network and retrieve 
their confidential materials. With the stolen confidential materials, I can sell off the information on the dark web for everyone to buy and use for monetary benefit.

There are 2 versions for the Attack Path Document.
- 1st version: Has spelling mistakes.
- 2nd version: I have made minor amendments such as spelling mistakes and added an image for the final steps.
